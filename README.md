# JarduinoWebsite
A Website to present the Jarduino project.

## The project
This is an automated watering system using Arduino, moisture sensors and solenoid valves. When the moisture in a plant pot drops below a certain point, the Arduino will send a signal to the valves. They will in turn let water flow from the tap to the plants.

It was made as a school project with two of my friends, over the course of 4 months.

## The website
It uses Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
